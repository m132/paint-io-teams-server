# Paint.IO Teams Server
An unofficial, fan-made server for GAMEE's Paint.IO Teams.

The game was taken off GAMEE.com on October 27, 2021, with all official servers shut down shortly after. This program implements the protocol of [build 1019](https://games.cdn.gamee.io/games/game-245/38-7bd6b9f1-30e8-40b8-946c-aba94186ca51.zip), the last public release of the client before the game was discontinued.

Live demo of the latest working snapshot can be found [here](https://paintio.m132.eu/)!

## Installation and configuration
```
# install dependencies and compile typescript sources
npm install

# start the server with default configuration
npm start

# alternatively, a full list of configuration options can be viewed with

```

## Bugs
The server is still under development, and as such, we don't currently accept bug reports.
